# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Personal Notes
React is a JS library that consist of components and allow us to create single page applications
## index html file
there is only one index.html file exist that request to server after that react takes over 
if you want to link or add meta tag you do in this html file
## app js file
is the main component(parent component) that is created initially
Every component is actually a function that return something. We need to always export that to be able to use in our index js to render to the DOM
you can write any JS code before return 
WHEN WE USE {} react knows that we want to use dynamic value of variables..
OBJECTS as well as booleans ARE NOT VALID REACT CHILD so we can not use as dynamic variable before return
## index js file
that takes all our react components mounting them into DOM (in root div) with render method
REACT STRICT MODE means it gives oss warning interactively if it is some error
## package json file
it lists all the dependencies of the application

## node modules folder
has all necessary modules inclusive react. When you work with github repos it usually exclude this folder because of its huge size
so you can always reload by typing 
"npm install" to the terminal  

### Extra notes
1. if you have install extension simple react snippets
you can create a functional component by just typing 
"sfc" which will create an arrow function inside our newly created component
